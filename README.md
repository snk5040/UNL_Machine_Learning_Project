# UNL_Machine_Learning_Project
This repository contains code for the final project for Machine Learning course at UNL (CSCE 878).

## Dataset: [Predicting a Biological Response](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bioresponse)

The data was source from a Kaggle competition.  The data consists of 1776 features and 3751 molecules.

The predictive task consists of predicting a binary biological response given the features for a molecule.

Features are normalized and anonymized.

## Features

3 Learners were implemented to train on the dataset.  The code for all three are in the repository.

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Deep Learning Model

Traditional Machine Learning performed better than Deep Learning for this problemset.
