## Dataset [Predicting a biological response](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bioresponse)

The dataset was sourced from a Kaggle competition hosted by Boehringer Ingelheim.

The data consists of 1776 features for 3751 molecules.  The predictive task involves using the features to predict a binary biological response.

## Machine Learning Approach

3 different approaches were implemented and tested.

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Deep Learning ANN
